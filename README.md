I recreated the German Dvorak layout that exists on my Ubuntu-based 
Linux distro in the MS Keyboard Layout Creator so I can use it on 
Microsoft Windows as well.

The .klc file can be opened with MS Keyboard Layout Creator
At the time I am writing this, it is available here:

I tried to add as many dead key combinations as I could - though this 
may not work on Windows for all these combinations, depending on the 
current locale... or something. 
The verification log (KeyboardVerify.log) gives you some impression of 
what may not work in, say, Notepad or Notepad++.

Ogonek and Cedilla are on the same key - they overlap only for e, and I 
found no concrete language usage of "e cedilla" searching the web.

I took a bit of freedom with the hyphen key - hyphen-minus seems to be 
the "normal hyphen" character.
Also, I made some keys (like "degree sign") dead unlike in the original.
